  infoText: In the heart of the Whispering Mountains, where the winds carve melodies
    into jagged peaks, lies an ancient guardian known as Kaelthor, the Stone Titan.
    Shrouded in myth and fear, Kaelthor is said to have been forged by the gods themselves
    to protect the sacred Heart of Aedra, a gem pulsating with the life force of
    the realm. Towering as high as the cliffs it calls home, its body is a mosaic
    of obsidian, granite, and shimmering veins of crystal, giving it an appearance
    both majestic and terrifying.  Legends tell of Kaelthor's awakening during times
    of great imbalance. When greed-fueled empires attempt to claim the Heart of Aedra,
    the Titan emerges, its thunderous footsteps shaking the ground and its roar echoing
    like an avalanche. Despite its immense strength, Kaelthor is not a mindless destroyer.
    It tests those who dare to approach the Heart, measuring their worthiness not
    by might alone but by wisdom and intention. Many adventurers have tried to outwit
    the guardian, but most return broken, both in body and spirit, or never return
    at all.
