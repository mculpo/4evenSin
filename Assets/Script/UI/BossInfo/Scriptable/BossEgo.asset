  infoText: Ego is a feared boss who resides in the heart of an ancient fortress,
    shrouded in mist and darkness, where his presence is felt before being seen.
    His body is a blend of pure energy and distorted flesh, with floating tentacles
    and crystalline fragments surrounding him. The most striking feature of his appearance
    is a colossal eye located at the center of his forehead, its pupil glowing with
    an ominous intensity. This eye not only watches but also reads the minds of his
    enemies, revealing their deepest fears and weaknesses, using this knowledge to
    strike in unpredictable ways.  His most dreaded ability is the "Vision of Truth,"
    where he projects distorted images of every soul who dares face him, causing
    their minds to fall prey to illusions and despair. Additionally, Ego possesses
    a devastating psychic power capable of disintegrating any physical obstacle in
    his path. His tentacles, imbued with arcane energy, can stretch at the speed
    of light, capturing and disintegrating those who fail to dodge in time. His battle
    is a true test against fear and the adventurers' own egos, as they must confront
    their greatest insecurities or fall victim to his oppressive influence.
